Heap lab work for DIHT MIPT (2018, 1 sem)

time_results.txt contains time measurements on my pc.<br>
Tests directory contains files with tests written with
GoogleTest framework. main.cpp should be executed in order
to run these tests; also, googletest framework file should
 be put in a directory 'lib' in the root of the project.

STL is not used in project, excluding cstdlib for
size_t type, some exceptions (std::logic_error,
std::invalid_argument, etc.) and priority_queue class for testing.
